# introduction

This is a vehicle rental software designed and developed as part of a team project for a course. Users can utilize the software on the Android platform for vehicle rentals, while administrators can manage, maintain, and view data through the web interface.

# Source code

source code is in the source_code_distribution folder

evss_backend contains the backend source(using spring boot) folder and one built jar file(which can use java to run).

evss_frontend contains the web end source and one output folder(which can directly run by web browser)

user_end contains the android source code and one apk(which can be installed in android phones)

# etc

Additional documentation has also been uploaded to the folder.

In this project, I took on some of the design responsibilities and handled the majority of the backend work. I would like to extend my gratitude to the other participants for their contributions to the project. The participants can be seen at the beginning of the demonstration video.
